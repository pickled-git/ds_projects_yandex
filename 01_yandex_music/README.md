## Analysis of Music Preferences of Streaming Service Users

### Project Objective

Verify data and compare the behavior and preferences of users from the two capitals - Moscow and Saint Petersburg, based on the real data from the Yandex.Music service.

### Project Description

Comparisons between Moscow and Saint Petersburg are surrounded by myths. For example:

- Moscow - a megacity, subservient to the rigid rhythm of the work week;
- Saint Petersburg - the cultural capital, with its own tastes.
  
Using the data from Yandex.Music, we compare the behavior of users from the two capitals and test hypotheses:
1. User activity depends on the day of the week. However, this is manifested differently in Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
2. On Monday mornings, certain genres prevail in Moscow, and different ones in Saint Petersburg. The same goes for Friday evenings, different genres prevail depending on the city.
3. Moscow and Saint Petersburg prefer different music genres. Pop music is more often listened to in Moscow, while Russian rap is more popular in Saint Petersburg.
